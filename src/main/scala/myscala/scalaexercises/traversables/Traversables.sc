//At the top of the collection hierarchy is trait Traversable. Its only abstract operation is foreach:
//Collection classes that implement Traversable just need to define this method; all other methods can be inherited
// from Traversable.
//The foreach method is meant to traverse all elements of the collection, and apply the given operation, f, to each
// element. The type of the operation is Elem => U, where Elem is the type of the collectionâ€™s elements and U is an
// arbitrary result type. The invocation of f is done for its side effect only; in fact any function result of f is
// discarded by foreach.
// Traversables are the superclass of Lists, Arrays, Maps, Sets, Streams, and more. The methods involved can be applied
// to each other in a different type. ++ appends two Traversables together.
