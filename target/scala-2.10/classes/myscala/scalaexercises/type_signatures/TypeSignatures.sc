/*
A methodâ€™s type signature comprises its name, the number, order, and types of its parameters, if any, and its result
type. The type signature of a class, trait, or singleton object comprises its name, the type signatures of all of its
members and myscala.scalaexercises.constructors, and its declared inheritance and mixin relations.
In Java you declare a generic type within a <>, in Scala it is []
